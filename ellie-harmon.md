PhD Candidate at UC Irvine working with Melissa Mazmanian. "In particular, I am
interested in how ubiquitous computing technologies are part of a more diffuse
and systemic ethos of limit-transcendence - a striving twoards, and belief in
the possibility of, always doing 'more'.

E. Harmon and M. Mazmanian, “Stories of the Smartphone in Everyday Discourse:
Conflict, Tension &#38; Instability,” in Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference
on Human Factors in Computing Systems, New York, NY, USA, 2013, pp. 1051–1060.

Cultural discourse analysis of advertisements and news articles about
smartphones, highlighting two tropes: increased technological integration, and
dis-integrating smartphones from daily life. The tropes call on the same values
(autonomy and control, togetherness and community, productivity and
effectiveness), but compel individuals to take opposing actions. Identifies
four subject positions: the 'out of touch luddite', 'multi-task master',
'distracted addict', and 'authentic human'.

- "We should be steadfast in refusing to sweep under the rug the messy
  cultural, social, economic, political, and institutional pressures that shape
  use and experience beyond the moment of a user's physical interaction with a
  technological object."
- "Neither values nor subjectivities are stable - the same user can experience
  autonomy through engaging with their smart phone or casting it aside, and
  this experience might shift in a matter of minutes."
- "Dis-integration would, in reality, entail not just the removal of the
  smartphone, but a disintegration - a fracturing, a shattering, a collapsing -
  of a whole way of life. Smartphones are embedded in varied and multiple
  practices of work, care, pleasure, and sociality. They cannot be
  dis-entangled from these practices in a simple and straightforward manner."
- "A technological object does not have the agency to radically reconfigure
  one's life. Technologies alone do not cause 'addiction' or 'distraction'.
  Rather, they provide capacities that people take into account and negotiate
  in establishing norms, expectations, and patterns of interaction."
- "The _practices_ required to enact the alternate visions of each core value
  are mutually exclusive. A person simply cannot be enacting the integrated
  vision of togetherness while engaging in the disintegrated vision of the same
  value."
- "While activism might take many forms, one starting point is recognizing our
  own role not just as designers of things that impart certain values, but also
  as storytellers."
